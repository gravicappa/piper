# Description

`piper` is a tool to effectively work in REPL-based development environments
(CL, Scheme, TCL, ...). It creates fifo `:in` in current directory and runs
program in pty. Any input to `:in` is sent to stdin of running by piper
process. It is convenient to set up a macro/ command in your text editor such
as 'send selection/s-expr to :in'.

`stdio` is a `piper` without fifo. So it just runs program in pty and sends
input from stdin there and pty's output to stdout.
